The Robot Rigger add-on for Blender provides a convenient way to automatically rig and unrig objects to bones based on a naming pattern. This tool is designed for quickly rigging robots, mechanical objects, and non-organic items. This is a micro-framework and designed to be non-intrusive to your existing Blender workflow.
